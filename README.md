# GameIT - A Game Engine
## Any Body Can Do Efficient Fantastic Games (ABCDEFG)
Short description of the project
	The project is about building a game engine which is capable of building 2D games. The tools to be added are stated below and the language used is Java. The key part of the game engine are the pre-defined classes and functions which configures the whole game play for the user.  

## How to run??
1. Download the project and launch it on Eclipse.
2. Run the project normally and enjoy playing our test game which is built on our GameIT game engine.
3. Feel free to create your own games using our game engine.
NOTE: The game is just to showcase the abilities of GameIT game engine and is not a fully developed game for gamers. 

## Tools needed
1.	Gradle Build Tool.

2.   JDT APT - It adds annotation processing support to Java 5 projects in Eclipse.

3.   JDT Core - It defines the non-UI infrastructure and an indexed based search infrastructure that is used for searching, code assist, type hierarchy computation, and refactoring.
4.   JDT Debug - It implements Java debugging support and works with any JDPA-compliant target Java VM.

     5. JDT Text provides the Java editor with the following features:
•	Keyword and syntax coloring
•	Context specific (Java, Javadoc) code assist and code select
6. The JDT UI provides refactoring support like: Extract Method or Safe Rename for Java elements that also updates references. 
7. 2D design tools like paint.net, Gimp etc.
8. 2D animations using Blender.
Major tools stated above are included in the ECLIPSE Integrated Development Environment, so we opt it.






## Time line
1. Till Midsem 1: Core Structure of the engine and some basic components like some static SpriteSheets (stones and nature).
2. Till Midsem 2: Improving the whole layout and building custom AI (Combination of Heuristics & Knowledge base) to go with the game engine.
3. Before comprehensive: Syncing the engine to work on a web browser through java applet classes. 

## Heirarchy of targets
1. Sprites & SpriteSheets designing and layout designing using “paint.net” and other 2D rendering tools and Building a test game out of the end product of Game Engine
2. Core design and implementation of all the Static sprites and flow of levels in the game and behavior and properties of them.
3. Handling the players (Dynamic sprites) as well as the environments including their behavior, properties, Physics behind the game and providing heuristic AI knowledge to the players and integrating Game bot as stated in additional target below.
4. Syncing the project and then making a website to render the game on the web server as an applet/jar file.

 ## Deliverables
  We are planning to deliver a fully functioning game engine with all sprites and tools with support for web browser. The classes which are built can be used to create various methods and configured systematically to make different innovative 2D games which deals with our surroundings. The game engine is capable of building Zelda level games. Rest is left to the user creativity which leads to great future projects.

## Additional Target: 
   We may also try to integrate a game bot in the game engine which allows user to test the game which is built by him/her and rectify the flaws in it. Which is not usually possible by a human until played for a long time. This would be a revolution in the game making field.
            Tools used:        OpenAI libraries like Universe and Gym
		                           Tensorflow, Theano for Machine learning algorithms
		        Basic libraries like Sklearn, SciPy, Panda for Data (player moves) analysis
